\usage{
  compare_distributions(d1, d2)
}
\arguments{
  \item{d1}{distribution objects}

  \item{d2}{distribution objects}
}
\value{
  A list giving total, mean and standard deviation of the
  log likelihood ratio points. Also returned, is Vuong's
  test statistic (normalized pointwise log likelihood
  ratio), one-sided and two-sided p-values (based on
  asymptotical standard Gaussian distribution)
}
\description{
  This function compares two models. The null hypothesis is
  that both classes of distributions are equally far (in
  the Kullback-Leibler divergence/relative entropy sense)
  from the true distribution.  If this is true, the
  log-likelihood ratio should (asymptotically) have a
  Normal distribution with mean zero. The test statistic is
  the sample average of the log likelihood ratio,
  standardized by a consistent estimate of its standard
  deviation.  If the null hypothesis is false, and one
  class of distributions is closer to the "truth", this
  test statistic goes to +-infinity with probability 1,
  indicating the better-fitting class of distributions.
  (See, in particular, Theorem 5.1 on p. 318 of his paper.)
}
\details{
  The function returns a "one-sided" p-value, which is an
  upper limit on getting that small a log likelihood ratio
  if the first distribution, \code{d1}, is actually true,
  and a "two-sided" p-value, which is the probability of
  getting a log likelihood ratio which deviates that much
  from zero in _either_ direction, if the two distributions
  are actually equally good.
