#' Vuong's test for non-nested models
#' 
#' 
#' This function compares two models. The null hypothesis is that both classes of
#' distributions are equally far (in the Kullback-Leibler divergence/relative
#' entropy sense) from the true distribution.  If this is true, the
#' log-likelihood ratio should (asymptotically) have a Normal distribution
#' with mean zero. The test statistic is the sample average of the log
#' likelihood ratio, standardized by a consistent estimate of its standard
#' deviation.  If the null hypothesis is false, and one class of distributions is 
#' closer to the "truth", this test statistic goes to +-infinity with probability 1,
#' indicating the better-fitting class of distributions.  (See, in particular,
#' Theorem 5.1 on p. 318 of his paper.) 
#' 
#' The function returns a "one-sided" p-value, which is an upper limit
#' on getting that small a log likelihood ratio if the first distribution, \code{d1},
#'  is actually true, and a "two-sided" p-value, which is the probability of getting a log likelihood
#' ratio which deviates that much from zero in _either_ direction, if the two
#' distributions are actually equally good.

#' @return A list giving total, mean and standard deviation of the log likelihood ratio points.
#' Also returned, is Vuong's test statistic (normalized pointwise log likelihood ratio), 
#' one-sided and two-sided p-values (based on asymptotical standard Gaussian distribution)
#' @note Code initially based on R code developed by Cosma Rohilla Shalizi (http://bactra.org/)
