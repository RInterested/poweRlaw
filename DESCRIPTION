Title: Fitting power laws to discrete and continuous data
Version: 0.15.2
Date: 2013-02-14
Author: Colin Gillespie
Maintainer: Colin Gillespie <colin.gillespie@newcastle.ac.uk>
Description: This package implements both the discrete and continuous maximum
    likelihood estimators for fitting the power-law distribution to data.
    Additionally, a goodness-of-fit based approach is used to estimate the
    lower cut-off for the scaling region. The code developed in this package
    has been heavily influnenced from the python and R code found at:
    http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/ . In particular, the R code of
    Laurent Dubroca.
